 ME_Sus_Events.1.t: "An Imposter Among Us"
 ME_Sus_Events.1.d: "One of our heralds reports that a man has been spotted pretending to be [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] himself in one of the major cities of the realm. Unfortunately, the local garrison has chosen to believe the man instead of apprehending him, which gave the imitator enough time to be showered in gifts and to cause chaos in the city. The imposter is allegedly on his way to other cities of the realm to use his deceptive tactics for personal gain.\n\nOr so it would seem, if not for the fact that no other reports of such activity have been reported, and the likeliness of such occurence is close to none. It is suspected that the herald has simply gone insane. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] could of course choose to believe him and to try and find which rival of ours decided to send a spy to our cities."
 ME_Sus_Events.1.a: "We will find the imposter!"

 ME_Sus_Events.2.t: "Calling An Emergency Meeting" 
 ME_Sus_Events.2.d: "As the news of the impostor incident broke, [Root.Monarch.GetName] was quick to call an Emergency Meeting in the court. The reason, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] cites, is that there is a conspiracy against him. Then the accusations started and the room discussion turned into who can shout the loudest. So chaotic it was, that even I don't know who was where and what tasks they had done. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] told everyone to shut up at once and then said:" 
 ME_Sus_Events.2.a: "We must stick together from now on."

 ME_Sus_Events.4.d: "While it may be hard to believe, after capturing this one peculiar local Sheikh, who looked oddly similar to the old master, we can be finally conclude that we have ejected the imposter. The imitator of course tried to claim innocence citing alibi - "I was in the city of Sousse conducting diplomacy!" - but noone would believe him. After this he tried to accuse one of his courtiers wearing a white turban when he uttered "White sus-" - at which moment he had his mouth shut by one of our generals. The imposter is surely found... or is he?" 
 ME_Sus_Events.4.a: "Yes, now decapitate him!" 
 ME_Sus_Events.4.b: "Very suspicious... is [Root.Monarch.GetName]! Indeed, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was the imposter all along!"

 ME_Sus_Events.7.t: "Choice of Claim Fabrication"
