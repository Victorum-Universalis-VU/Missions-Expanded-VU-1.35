    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.7.t: "Fate of the Normans" 
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.7.d: "The land at the north of France is one with a long history of struggles and bloody conquest. For centuries the locals developed their own battle-hardened and laconic philosophy and outlook towards life. Devoid of the notion of a social structure and speaking some weird pompous-sounding dialect, it befalls us to decide what to do with these peculiar people in our newly-conquered Western lands." 
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.7.a: "We must respect and preserve their traditions."
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.7.b: "Uncultured remnants of a brutal past..."
    
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.8.t: "Summer Palace of [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.8.d: "Few conquerors across the ages have had the prestige, neigh the nobility and skill to conquer the heart of France. In the ruins of the once-great city we shall erect a summer palace for [Root.Monarch.GetName] to celebrate his victory and supremacy over the mighty French armies that defended their former homelands. The palace will carry and promote the legitimacy and wealth befitting a truly magnanimous monarch as we strive to leave our mark in history." 
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.8.a: "Commission its construction immediately!"
    
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.9.t: "Success of the Glorious Revolution of [GetYear]"
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.9.d: "Several successes in our frontlines in Britain have deemed us and our monarch eligible to claim supremacy and victory in the Isles. As is customary and expected, the citizenry looks upon us to reaffirm their defacto rights and a measure of autonomy under their new ruler via the signing of a Bill of Rights to protect individual freedoms and promote assimilation of our two kins." 
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.9.a: "Sign the bill, bring our people closer!" 
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.9.b: "I refuse."
    
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.10.t: "Doctorate Rights in the Netherlands"
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.10.d: "Despite the generous amount of literate individuals around our urban environments, for centuries the rights to granting doctorate degrees were exclusively and zealously guarded by the nobility. With the construction of the first state-funded faculties of high education, we are now able to elevate our citizens' access to education and grant doctorate certification." 
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.10.a: "Education should be affordable and accessible for all!"
    
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.11.t: "The Port of Amsterdam"
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.11.d: "The first port activities in Amsterdam date back to the 13th century. The port was first mentioned in the year 1342, when the city of Amsterdam received city rights. Recently, in the Dutch Golden Age the port has been transformed to one of the main harbours of the Dutch East India Company and our operations around the globe. Merchants bring exotic goods to our markets from shores of extreme distance as they are attracted by the busy vibe of our beautiful city, the new pearl of our affluent times!" 
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.11.a: "The staple of our golden era!"
    
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.13.t: "Mother of All Trades"
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.13.d: "Gems, jewels, gold and all the world's most valuable trade goods are surely a profitable endeavour. However, what shall our people eat, if not the wheat of the earth ? Trading in precious minerals and stones is certainly needed in order to generate income for our state and administration but after consolidating the grain trade, we shall do our best to maintain and increase our grain produce, and grow a healthy populace across our vast lands from Rotterdam to Friesland."
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.13.a: "Grain is the bedrock of Empires across the ages!"
    
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.14.t: "The Dutch Trade League"
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.14.d: "The Hanseatic League was an influential medieval commercial and defensive confederation of merchant guilds and market towns in central and northern Europe spearheaded by the city of Lubeck. For centuries their merchants dominated many ports from the Low Countries to Novgorod. With our recent conquests in the region, we have proved sufficiently powerful to shoulder the League's business and fill the power vacuum left in their absence."
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.14.a: "A new era of maritime business!"
    
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.15.t: "Michiel de Ruyter and the Amsterdam Admiralty"
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.15.d: "Widely celebrated and regarded as one of the most skilled admirals in history, de Ruyter is arguably most famous for his achievements with the Dutch Navy during the Anglo-Dutch Wars. He fought the English and French forces and scored several critical victories, with the Raid on the Medway being the most famous among them. Often dubbed a Dutch folk hero, de Ruyter is one of a few select officers in the history of the Dutch navy to hold the title of the lieutenant admiral. Reportedly beloved by his subordinates and seamen, de Ruyter was commonly nicknamed 'grandfather' during his service. He remained in the service of the Dutch navy in the one of the highest posts until he accepted an offer from the Admiralty of Amsterdam to become their vice-admiral on 2 March 1654."
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.15.a: "One of our most skilled admirals to sprearhead our mighty fleet."
    
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.16.t: "Foreign Trade Posts of the Republic"
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.16.d: "A vast trade network once headed by the mighty Hansa, the Kontor system now lies in ruins. With the passing of the last Hanseatic head of state and the abolition of the majority of the Trade League, their offices were abandoned, along with intricate plans of administration and ledgers of business. Whether we choose to adopt their existing systems or promote our own, we have certainly prevailed over a long-time foe!"
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.16.a: "Implement the system."
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.16.b: "We cannot loosen our regulations." 
    
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.17.t: "Modernization of the Naval Forces"
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.17.d: "Expertise in the naval affairs has so far proven vital for the growth of our lands, both militarily and maritime-wise. With Europe at the cusp of a big war, as Great Powers vie for power from Iberia to the shores of Great Britain, it is deemed of great importance to develop a modernized and focused naval force that will either assist and safeguard our merchants or strike fear as our mighty cannons roar!"
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.17.a: "Let us focus on expanding our mercantile fleet." 
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.17.b: "Our enemies will tremble at the sound of our cannons!" 
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.17.c: "Our Flemish expertise will shine in the waves!" 
    
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.18.t: "Korps Mariniers" 
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.18.d: "The corps was founded [GetYear] during the one of the most turbulent times of European history by the then grand pensionary of the Dutch Republic, Johan de Witt, and Admiral Michiel de Ruyter as the Regiment de Marine. The first commander of the corps was Willem Joseph van Ghent. Our admirals had successfully used conventional troops embarked on ships during the many wars of our glorious past. However, the introduction of new naval tactics and specialization of fleets deemed it necessary to found a new corps. The Korps Mariniers was the fifth European Marine unit formed, being preceded by Spain's Infantería de Armada in 1537, the Portuguese Marine Corps in 1610, France's Troupes de marine in 1622 and the English Royal Marines in 1664, although our Dutch Marines were the first in history to specialise in amphibious operations." 
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.18.a: "As far as the world extends!"
    
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.19.t: "Shaping the Dutch Law"
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.19.d: "Hugo Grotius is a major figure in the fields of philosophy, political theory and law during the sixteenth and seventeenth century. Along with the earlier works of Francisco de Vitoria and Alberico Gentili, he shall lay the foundations for international law, based on natural law in its Protestant side. Two of his books have had a lasting impact in the field of international law, De Jure Belli ac Pacis [On the Law of War and Peace] dedicated to Louis XIII of France and the Mare Liberum [The Free Seas]. Grotius intends to also contribute significantly to the evolution of the notion of rights. Before his arrival in our court, rights were above all perceived as attached to objects. After him, they may be seen as belonging to persons, as the expression of an ability to act or as a means of realizing something." 
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.19.a: "A brilliant man!"
    
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.20.t: "The Dutch East Indies Company"
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.20.d: "The Dutch East Indies Company was founded in [GetYear] in order to manage our overseas maritime and exploration endeavours beyond the Cape. Many experienced advisors in our court support the notion of the first corporation, a government-funded, privately owned business whose first cornerstone is to pursue exorbitant amounts of profit and returns on behalf of the Dutch crown by any means necessary. Whether we choose to finance the company or push onwards without private entities, the wealth of India and unknown lands beckons!" 
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.20.a: "Charter the VOC!"
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.20.b: "Nevermind."
    
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.21.t: "Trade in Mainland China" 
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.21.d: "Mainland China is legendary for its wealth and production of exotic goods. As our explorers and settlers make their ways off the shores of Taiwan, trade between our two people becomes inevitable. Perhaps, given the fact that we are on good terms with our neighbors, it would be a worthwile endeavour to send an emissary across the seas in order to negotiate the purchase of the nearby port city of Canton." 
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.21.a: "Send an envoy!"
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.21.b: "We have better use for our coin..."
    
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.22.t: "Envoy from the Western Courts" 
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.22.d: "An envoy from Taiwan, the stronghold of the Dutch, has arrived in our court. He brings word from his white masters. Apparently, they offer to purchase [667.GetName] for the price of 1500 ¤ as a sign of friendship and cooperation..." 
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.22.a: "Sign the document!"
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.22.b: "I refuse."
    
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.23.t: "Voyage to Japan"
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.23.d: "Miriads of deadly waves, a long voyage of hundreds of days and many men lost at sea is the price we pay to push the boundaries of knowledge of our blue globe. One of these voyages brings a brave band of Dutch captains in the shores of a peculiar and very interesting island. Despite both parties being careful in regards to first contact and interaction, the merry bunch of Dutch sailors visited the shogun in Kyoto and even broke bread with their Japanese counterparts. They return to their port, months later carrying gifts for our monarch and a letter of thanks signed by the Japanese Shogun himself! Is this a new era of friendship and cooperation between our two nations?" 
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.23.a: "What an incredible people!"
    
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.24.t: "Rembrandt van Rijn & the Dutch Arts"
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.24.d: "As is often customary and expected, coin and a golden era of maritime exploration is swiftly followed by an uptick in literacy, education and arts. One of the most influential men of the Dutch Golden Age, Rembrandt is an innovative and prolific master of painting, printmaking and more. He is generally considered one of the greatest visual artists in the history of art and the most important in Dutch art history. Unlike most Dutch masters of the 17th century, Rembrandt's works depict a wide range of style and subject matter, from portraits and self-portraits to landscapes, genre scenes, allegorical and historical scenes, and biblical and mythological themes as well as animal studies. His contributions to art come in a period of great wealth and cultural achievement that we have eloquently dubbed the Dutch Golden Age, when Dutch art (especially Dutch painting), although in many ways antithetical to the Baroque style that dominated Europe, has become extremely prolific and innovative and is giving rise to important new genres." 
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.24.a: "Painting is the grandchild of Nature..."
    
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.25.t: "Powerhouse in the Book Trade" 
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.25.d: "As our urban centres dominate the markets, attracting visitors and passers-by that purchase our goods from all around the globe, one unforeseen side-effect of that is the increased production and consumption of books across our grand nation! Large books, pocket-sized books, cook books and scientific papers, a wave of thought and intelligent growth is sweeping across our nation!" 
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.25.a: "A room without books is like a body without a soul."
    
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.26.t: "The Black Army of Arum Rises"
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.26.d: "The Arumer Zwarte Hoop, commonly known as the Black Army of Arum is an army of peasant rebels and mercenaries in Friesland fighting against the local feudal authorities in [GetYear]. For four years they were successful under the former farmer Pier Gerlofs Donia and their cause has called many peasant across Frisia to arms. Such hubris and insolence must be swiftly dealt with!" 
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.26.a: "Let's hope the forts will hold until reinforcements arrive."
    
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.27.t: "Act of Abjuration"
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.27.d: "The few initial cities and provinces that came together in [GetYear] to proclaim the Dutch Confederation of cities has now officially published its first declaration, the Act of Abjuration. In the document, many laws shared commonly by the united provinces are laid in great detail, as well as a proclamation of sovereignty and the determination to never again bow down to any outside conquerors. Today is a day we celebrate our formation, independence and the beginning of nation's glorious history." 
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.27.a: "This treaty will be the beginning of our great nation!"
    
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.28.t: "Alexander Farnese"
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.28.d: "Starting his career as a nobleman and a condottiero in Italy, Alexander Farnese swiftly proved his worth as a military commander. Soon after he was contracted by the Iberian crown to enlist in their armed forces and serve as a general. His command in the Low Countries led to the capture of many cities in swift succession. Masterful manipulation both politically and diplomatically have favored him as the next Governor General of the Low Countries..." 
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.28.a: "We shall accept his governorship."
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.28.b: "Let us remain defiant."
    
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.29.t: "William the Silent"
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.29.d: "One of the forefront figures of the past 20 years in both matters of diplomacy and warfare, William van Oranje, commonly nicknamed William the Silent is one of the greatest men of our time. His tenure in the forefronts of our independence struggle and vying for political power, expertly morphing himself into a marvellously capable prospecting ruler to head our great nation..." 
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.29.a: "He will make a fine head of state."
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.29.b: "We cannot abandon our current figurehead."
    
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.30.t: "Jan Amos Comenius"
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.30.d: "Jan Amos Comenius is a Czech philosopher, pedagogue and theologian who is considered the father of modern education. He served as the last bishop of the Unity of the Brethren before becoming a religious refugee and one of the earliest champions of universal education, a concept eventually set forth in his book Didactica Magna. As an educator and theologian, he led schools and advised governments across Protestant Europe through the middle of the seventeenth century." 
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.30.a: "What a brilliant mind!"
    
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.31.t: "Antonie van Leeuwenhoek" 
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.31.d: "Antonie Philips van Leeuwenhoek is a Dutch businessman and scientist in the Golden Age of Dutch science and technology. A largely self-taught man in science, he is commonly known as "the Father of Microbiology", and one of the first microscopists and microbiologists. Van Leeuwenhoek is best known for his pioneering work in microscopy and for his contributions toward the establishment of microbiology as a scientific discipline." 
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.31.a: "Long live the father of microbiology!"
    
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.32.t: "Jan Leeghwater"
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.32.d: "Jan Leeghwater was born in De Rijp in [GetYear] and became famous as a Dutch architect, mill builder and hydraulic engineer. His revolutionary work revamped many cities and mills across the Dutch countryside and he was among the first to advocate reclamation of the Haarlemmermeer, a lake whose growth presented a danger to the surrounding towns given that several villages were swallowed and even Amsterdam and Leiden were eventually threatened."
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.32.a: "A gifted man of construction and architecture!"
    
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.33.t: "Joost van den Vondel"
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.33.d: "Joost van den Vondel is a Dutch poet, writer and playwright. He is considered the most prominent Dutch poet and playwright of the 17th century. His plays are the ones from that period that are still most frequently performed, and his epic Joannes de Boetgezant (1662), on the life of John the Baptist, has been called the greatest Dutch epic. Vondel's theatrical works were regularly performed for centuries. The most visible was the annual performance, on New Year's Day from 1637, of Gijsbrecht van Aemstel. Vondel remained productive until a very old age. Several of his most notable plays like Lucifer and Adam in Exile were written after 1650, when he was already 65, and his final play Noah, written at the age of eighty, is considered one of his finest." 
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.33.a: "What a performance!"
    
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.34.t: "High Cuisine in the Low Countries"
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.34.d: "High cuisine developed out of political and social changes in France and recently in [GetYear] reached the homes and restaurants of the Low Countries. The "high" cuisine represented a hierarchy in 17th-century Europe as only the privileged could eat it. High cuisine distinguished itself from regular Western European cuisine by what was cooked and served (such as foods like tongue and caviar) by serving foods such as fruit out of season, by making it difficult and time-consuming to cook, and by using exotic ingredients not typically found in Europe." 
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.34.a: "Finally, some delicious food!"
    
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.35.t: "Scenes of Everyday Life"
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.35.d: "A general category for artworks that depict ordinary people—whether documented or staged—in everyday life. The 17th and 18th centuries saw a turn from the idealized depictions of classical figures and royalty towards realism, with painters like the 18th-Century Dutch Realists capturing the lives of ordinary people in genre paintings. Artists in the Low Countries today continue this legacy, focusing on the often mundane aspects of contemporary domestic life, from market shopping to walking down the street. "
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.35.a: "Art is the expression of the soul."
    
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.36.t: "The House of Elzevir"
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.36.d: "Elzevir Family, also spelled Elsevier, a family of Dutch booksellers, publishers, and printers, 15 members of which were in business between 1587 and 1681. They were best known for their books or editions of the Greek New Testament and the classics. Louis (1540?–1617), son of a printer of Leuven, settled in Leiden as a Protestant émigré about 1581, set himself up as a bookbinder and bookseller, published over 100 books, and began the family specialization in learned books. The business in Leiden enjoyed its greatest success between 1622 and 1652 under his son Bonaventure (1583–1652) and grandson Abraham (1592–1652), during the Dutch boom and height of book markets, they dealt with customers all around the globe, famous for their hard covers and highly-sought calligraphy." 
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.36.a: "Books a-plenty!"
    
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.37.t: "Beeldenstorm" 
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.37.d: "Dire times are ahead of us. Pockets of heretic believers, distraught with the corruption seething deep within our Church, have taken to the streets to protest and destroy all manner of religious symbols such as icons, statues and even churches themselves. This is by no means an isolated phenomenon, as the teachings of Luther shake the entire Catholic world and present a mortal danger to the stability and sovereignty of countless nations!"

    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.38.d: "Recent developments in our Western front have slowed down our expansion towards the lands north of France. Various generals suggest we abandon our plans to conquer Normandy and the Somme, and instead focusing our efforts in other, more pressing matters such as the British Isles to the Northwest and the Hanseatic League to the East."

    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.46.d: "Seven influential Englishmen have sent us a letter urging us to come and free their kingdom from its unpopular and unable king. According to the plotters their monarch has made a mess of domestic as well as foreign matters. They now turn to us as we are a devout Christian country free of papist influence."

    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.49.t: "The Evolution of the State Army"
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.49.d: "Europe is a continent that knows war, that much is true. Throughout our history we have clashed with our foes in numerous battlefields. Battle after battle we sometimes lost, won or withdrew with a pyrrhic victory. No matter the enemy's numbers or their expertise, though, we held our ground. Little by little we studied both our foes and our allies and through this accumulation and cultivation of knowledge we have finally managed to achieve a tremendous breakthrough in regards to the capabilities of our armed forces!"
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.49.a: "God created war so that Dutch would learn geography."
    
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.50.t: "The Eating of [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.50.d: "War and poverty have taken our people apart as the war against our rivals bodes badly. Misery and misfortune have a tight grip upon our people as angry mobs roam the street demanding retribution from the incompetence of [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Despite our best efforts and the security of the Palatial Complex, the angry peasants broke in the gardens, and shortly after [Root.Monarch.GetName] attempted to give one final, deprived and ineffective speech about unity and love, the mistress of [Root.Monarch.GetName] was promtly devoured by the enraging masses. Once the massacre was over, the unruly mob turned its gaze on [Root.Monarch.GetName] and reached out, like a mad animal. The body would later be cut up into pieces, parts of it were sold in the markets and some radical elements of the crowd would even drive their gnawing teeth into [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s bare, succulent flesh. Such are the dangers of incompetent ruleship at times of war..."
    FU_Holland_Netherlands_Events.50.a: "They're eating her, and then they will eat me! Oh my God!"
